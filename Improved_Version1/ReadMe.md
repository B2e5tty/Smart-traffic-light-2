Improvement 1: automatic calibration of roads limits

Calibration objects are put on the limits of the crossroads

Code modified in order to:
- automatically detect calibration objects
- deduce crossroads limits

Cars crossing the crossroads (so inside it and not one the roads anymore) and outisde the roads are not taken into account.
