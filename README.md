# Smart Traffic Lights 2 : Overview
The main goal of our project is to create traffic lights which allow to smartly manage the traffic on a road. 
To do so, traffic lights let past cars on the most blocked road, by detecting the number of cars on each road with a webcam fixed above the intersection. Thanks to that, traffic jams and pollution caused by stopped cars are decreased.
Two further improvements are also performed : 

1) The automatic detection of road limits in order to adapt the system to all sizes of road of cross crossroads.
2) The possibility of giving the priority to emergency vehicles, like ambulances or fire engines, or globally to large vehicles (because it is long to fire up, involving traffics jams and pollution).
