# Smart Traffic Lights 2 : Overview
The main goal of our project is to create traffic lights which allow to smartly manage the traffic on a road. 
To do so, traffic lights let past cars on the most blocked road, by detecting the number of cars on each road with a webcam fixed above the intersection. Thanks to that, traffic jams and pollution caused by stopped cars are decreased.
A further improvement is also considered : the possibility of giving the priority to emergency vehicles, like ambulances or fire engines, or globally to large vehicles (because it is long to start, involving traffics jams and pollution).
